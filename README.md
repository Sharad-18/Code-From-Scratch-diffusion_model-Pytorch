# Diffusion Model Project

This repository contains the complete implementation of a **custom diffusion model**, developed from scratch to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. The model leverages the power of diffusion processes combined with **Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)** to create stunning visuals based on input prompts. The entire pipeline is meticulously built using **PyTorch**, focusing on modularity, scalability, and extensibility.

## Project Overview

The **Diffusion Model** implemented in this project follows an advanced architecture that transforms random noise into detailed images. The key components involved in the process are:

- **Random Noise Initialization**: The image generation process starts by initializing the model with pure random noise, which gets iteratively denoised to produce meaningful content.
  
- **Encoder**: The encoder compresses the random noise into a latent space representation, which can then be iteratively refined throughout the diffusion steps.
  
- **CLIP Text Encoder**: This module converts textual descriptions (prompts) into **CLIP embeddings**, which serve as guidance for the image generation process, ensuring that the generated visuals correspond accurately to the provided text.
  
- **Diffusion Scheduler**: A carefully designed scheduler manages the progressive denoising steps, introducing time embeddings that control the diffusion process. These embeddings allow the model to iteratively refine the latent representations to resemble the target image.
  
- **Decoder**: The decoder transforms the refined latent space representations back into pixel space, producing the final high-resolution image as output.

## Features

- **Custom Diffusion Algorithm**: This model implements a fully custom diffusion process from scratch, giving fine-grained control over the denoising process and scheduling.
  
- **CLIP Integration**: Utilizes **CLIP** to bridge the gap between textual prompts and image representations, guiding the model to produce images that match the text descriptions.
  
- **High-Resolution Image Generation**: Capable of generating detailed, high-resolution images by progressively refining noise using the diffusion process.
  
- **PyTorch Implementation**: The model is implemented in **PyTorch**, making it easy to extend, modify, and integrate with other deep learning libraries.

## Architecture

1. **Random Noise Initialization**  
   The process begins by initializing the model with random noise, which will be refined into a coherent image.

2. **Text-to-Embedding with CLIP**  
   The textual prompt is processed using a pre-trained CLIP model, which converts the text into a latent embedding. This embedding guides the image generation process by aligning the image with the description.

3. **Latent Space Encoding**  
   The noise is passed through an encoder to map it to a lower-dimensional latent space.

4. **Diffusion Process**  
   Over several iterative steps, the scheduler adds controlled noise and refines it, transforming the random noise into meaningful patterns and shapes. The CLIP embedding influences these steps to ensure that the generated image aligns with the prompt.

5. **Decoding and Image Output**  
   The final latent representation is decoded back into pixel space, resulting in a high-quality image that represents the given text description.

## Future Work

- **Multi-Modal Inputs**: Expanding the model to support multi-modal inputs such as images and text combined for enhanced image synthesis.
  
- **Advanced Schedulers**: Incorporating more advanced scheduling techniques for even more precise control over the diffusion steps.

- **Fine-Tuning**: Implementing fine-tuning on specific datasets to generate domain-specific images based on prompts (e.g., medical, architectural, etc.).
